            <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>

            <p class="MoMA"><strong>MoMA.org uses color to convey hierarchy — the green links in the top right corner stand out in contrast to the black ones below the logo.</strong> 
                Good visual design uses color or contrast (or both) to create visual hierarchy on the page. Applying color to a design makes some elements appear to advance 
                and others to recede, and, thus, determines what grabs our attention and the importance we assign to various design elements. 
                It's not the actual color of an element that creates the hierarchy, but rather the contrast in value and saturation between the 
                element and the context in which it appears (including background and other nearby elements).

            </p>
            <p class="DOWSE"> <strong>Shopify checkout form fields: The proximity principle is apparent in good form design. 
                The minimal white space between the section headers and related form fields makes the relationship 
                clear — they belong together. </strong> There is also increased space between each chunk of fields, which further 
                helps the eye see this hierarchical spatial pattern. Note also the boundary around the two Express 
                checkout buttons (an example of the principle of common region), which separates them from the checkout form below.</p>

            <p class="STAAK">
                This London-based design studio has implemented the rule of thirds really well in their web page design.
                Using the grid, they've determined where there should be negative space and where to place their 
                attention-grabbing text. The eye naturally travels from the more graphic title text to the subtle 
                descriptive text on the bottom left.
